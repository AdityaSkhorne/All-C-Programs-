This Project is basically helpful for all college student who faces some problem in their written program , kindly refer this here i provide atmost all program of C  which should be known to one college student. 

# //REQUEST -  PLEASE UNDERSTAND//
Hey guys, all the program which is here is only to help students not to make them cheaters . I request you to please try it twice (try to build logic and think what the question ask) own,if after your loyal effort, logic not clicked then only come here and take this as a reference and after under standing it please try it again ,you will surely achieve sucess .

#
I provide the code file with name p1.c,p2.c,p3.c .....so on so you guys here take the reference which program is behind these names.

** 
// this means it is comment part of a program , sometimes in this comment part you get some excercise to solve  


I also provide output of the program  as comment.

# LIST OF PROGRAMS

//Basics Programs

p1.c =    WAP to print Hello World !
#
p2.c =    WAP to print my name and see the use of various Escape sequence
#
p3.c =    WAP to add , sub. , multiply , divide two numbers
#
p4.c =    WAP to find square & cube of a number
#
p5.c =    WAP to find area by Heron's formula
#
p6.c =    WAP to find area & circumference of circle.
#
p7.c =    WAP to convert degree celsius to farenheit
#
p8.c =    WAP to print ASCII value of character
#
p9.c =    WAP to swap two numbers with the help of third variable
#
p10.c =   WAP to swap two numbers without using  third variable
#
p11.c =   WAP to find average of 5 numbers
#
p12.c =   WAP to find Simple Interest 
#
// Programs  based on # Operators

p13.c =   WAP to see the how increment/decrement operators work 
#
p14.c =   WAP to find the size of datatypes, variable, constant
#
p15.c =   WAP to see the use of all Bitwise Operators
#
p16.c =   WAP to see the use of all Relational Operators
#
p17.c =   WAP to see the use of all Logical Operators
#
// Programs based on Decision Control statement
